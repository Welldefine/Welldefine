I am an individual who enjoys experimenting, thinking, learning, and creating.

I am currently a sophomore in the elite statistics program at the School of Statistics, Renmin University of China.
As a undergraduate student, my learning focuses on the statistic theory and practice in Machine learning.
**Looking ahead, my aspiration is to become a developer specializing in Machine Learning.**

I'm also a lover of LaTeX and Julia.
